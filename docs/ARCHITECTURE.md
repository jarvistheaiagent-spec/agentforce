# Architecture (draft)

## Goals
- Provide an Agentforce agent grounded in Salesforce + Data Cloud data.
- Provide a clean action layer (Apex/Flow/external APIs) with observability.

## Repo layout (planned)
- `force-app/` : Salesforce DX source (Apex, LWCs, Flows, etc.)
- `scripts/`   : automation (auth, deploy, seed data)
- `docs/`      : design + specs

## Notes
- Specs will be added later; this is a bootstrap only.
